# Snake Game

**🎮 Overview**

The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game built using Python.
It challenges players to control a moving snake that grows in size each time it eats food — while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

This project demonstrates the use of game loops, event handling, collision detection, and graphical rendering in Python — providing a fun and interactive way to understand how real-time games work.


**🎯 Objective**

To create an engaging and interactive version of the classic Snake game using Python, applying logic for:
Continuous movement & direction handling

Real-time input capture

Collision detection

Score tracking and game-over states


**🚀 Features**

✅ Smooth snake movement using keyboard input
✅ Random food generation
✅ Real-time score display
✅ Collision detection with self and boundaries
✅ Game-over screen and restart option
✅ Lightweight and runs directly in the terminal or window


**🧠 Problem It Solves**

This project serves as an educational and foundational project for understanding game development logic.
It helps new developers learn:

How real-time input handling works

How objects interact in 2D space

How to structure a continuous event loop

Basics of animation, timing, and rendering


**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Library: Pygame (for graphics, event handling, and sound)

IDE: Visual Studio Code / PyCharm

**⚙️ Installation & Setup**

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
cd snake-game

2. Install Dependencies
pip install pygame

3. Run the Game
python main.py


**🕹️ How to Play**

🎯 Goal: Eat as much food as possible to grow your snake!

Key	Action
⬆️	Move Up
⬇️	Move Down
⬅️	Move Left
➡️	Move Right


**💥 Game Over occurs when:**

The snake hits the wall

The snake collides with its own body

**📸 Sample Output**

🟢 Snake moves around collecting red food blocks,
📈 Score increases each time food is eaten,
💀 When the snake collides with itself or the border → "Game Over" message appears.


**🧩 Future Improvements**

Add sound effects for movement and collisions

Introduce multiple levels or speed modes

Create a high-score leaderboard

Add pause/resume functionality

Implement dark/light theme for the game window
